D3 visualization of a Perceptron
========

Along with [this blog post](http://maerch.github.io/2014/10/22/perceptron.html) `vpercp` will visualize the training of a single Perceptron used for a classification task. Add training data by clicking on the canvas or generate a bunch of random points. After the learning phase it is possible to "rewind" and display any iteration done by the Perceptron. 

Try it out [here](http://maerch.github.io/static/vpercp/)!

Since it is guaranteed that the Perceptron is going to converge in this linear case, the learning will not stop until it classified all training points correctly. Sometimes, though, it takes ages, so a reset could speed things up.
